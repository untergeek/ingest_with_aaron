# Data from the Ingest with Aaron series

Episodes are dated, so that hopefully makes it easier to find something in particular.

## Have an idea for an episode?

Do you have an Ingest-related problem you'd like help with? 

Submit your request as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/untergeek/ingest_with_aaron/issues),
and I will take it into consideration!

### What will be considered?

Your ideas might fit under one of these categories, or something else!

#### What is your hardest ingestion challenge?

For example:

* Is it throughput related? i.e., do you have a hard time keeping up with the volume of data?
* Is it data consistency related? e.g., are your data sources inconsistent such that your parsing rules don't always catch everything?
* Is it figuring out how to normalize or map your data? e.g., "How do I know which ECS field I should use, if any?"
* Is it data retention related? e.g., "My resources are finite. How do I keep what I can for as long as possible?"

#### What kind of content would help you in your current role?

For example:

* Detailed How-to guides for specific ingestion challenges
* Show me how to use **Shiny New Featureâ„¢**, or show how it will make my job easier
* Interviews and Q&A sessions with subject matter experts at Elastic
* Interviews and Q&A sessions with people outside Elastic who have solved problems like mine

#### Would you be willing to be on the show?

Would you, could you join a future session as a panelist if it meant that
Aaron could personally help you solve an Ingest problem at your work?

You would receive some free consultation time with Aaron, which hopefully either
resolves your problem, or sets you on the path for future success.

You would get a chance to be a panelist on the show and talk about your
experience, what you learned, and what was solved.

Appearing on the show is not a requirement for receiving this consultation help,
but it is preferred

You will also get free Elastic swag (TBD) mailed to you
